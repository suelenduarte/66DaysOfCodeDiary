<h1>66 Days Of Code Diary</h1>

<p>This is a dynamic website that uses mainly JavaScript by manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model). Besides JavaScript I used plain HTML5 and CSS3. It is hosted with Github Pages</p>

<p>I created this website for people who are starting to code keep track of their coding progress.</p>
